## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## My process

For this challenge I used HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I'm trying to focus more on accessibility and simplyfing my javascript code avoiding redundancies while keeping it simple.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I created the buttons with a for loop and in general I tried to use JS DOM manipulation more instead of modifying the HTML
